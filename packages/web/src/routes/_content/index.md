Welcome to the business correspondence site for Brian Takita,
	co-founder of LastingLogic.

This site is a work-in-progress to build the technology & design of a markdown-enabled
	documentation, technical correspondence, & personal information management (PIM) application.

Feel free to browse some matters.
The intent is to catalogue written business ideas & tech offerings.

This repository is publicly viewable &
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/business">forkable</a>.
It's also possible to have a private repository for your own records.
If there is an idea, feature suggestion, or bug you want to talk about,
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/business/issues">create an issue on Github</a>.

To browse the content correspondence, use the â†‘ navigation above.

## Design Considerations

This app has a minimalist design, focused on the content.
The application logic & information architecture is currently being developed.
This app is in dark mode by default to place less strain on the eyes,
	which is a factor when reading long passages of documentation.
