Dear Amanda,

Thank you for your offer re: compensation for our work up to date.
We go the extra mile for any of our paying clients.
In this case, we are willing & able to consult without charge on any concepts
	that have been presented in the holochain-developer-prototype demo.
If there is a contract between Holochain & us, we are also willing to waive this charge.
Regardless of our future relationship, we are excited about the developments within the Holochain ecosystem
	and will continue to follow & participate.

The intention of our offering was as follows.
I (Brian) would be offering development & documentation services.
I was to be the subject of the position that we have been discussing.
For this project, **Tracy was to assist me** in client communication, attending meetings,
	design & systems ideas/feedback, writing, etc.
She has been immensely helpful for several projects & it's highly beneficial to continue investing in
	this collaboration.

A negotiation on rates took place, resulting in a **price point well below industry average** for a
	full stack developer who can create a scalable system of components, practices, documentation,
	cloud-based interactive development environment, & starter apps using the Holochain application stack.
Tracy is to be an addition to our offering, rather than the focus.

I face some similar challenges to Holochain.
How to communicate a framework of tools, both of abstract forms & tangible software,
	to the public of various technical context & telos.
I have been developing software practices based on a
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy">Meta Philosophy</a> centered around:

* a scalable domain language
* patterns of definition
* globally unique names
* flat data structures
* functional reactive data flow

An explicit global domain language applied to business literature & code,
	results in a reduction of software & abstraction mapping needed to encapsulate ambiguous naming.
I have a couple of blog posts describing naming convention that adheres to the global domain language principle,
	that I have tested across a few organizations ranging in complexity.

* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.briantakita.com/posts/multi-underscore-tag-naming-convention-analysis/">
		Multi Underscore Tag Naming Convention Analysis
	</a>

I have created the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core">ctx-core</a> library,
	which is a composable monorepo used in several of my projects.
During this development, I have formed techniques to develop & reuse:

* application code
* library code
* web services
* web components
* project-specific development environments
* command line tools

My applicable experience lies crafting solutions that scale with complexity, interactivity, & reuse potential
	across the organization's domain.
While this practice is relatively young, I have obtained knowhow in creating a complex ecosystem of reuasabled
	apps, components, & services which can be reused as a catalog of starter projects varying in domain specificity.

My core libraries serve as the best indicator of example of my ability to architect composable systems that are:

* free of runtime framework dependencies
* small in payload
* low in memory usage
* fast in execution
* customizable for each development environment context

I am grateful for our investigation, as I created another repository for
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/business">public business</a> matters.
This project was forked from progress made with the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/holochain-developer-prototype">holochain-developer-prototype</a>
	repo.
I also extracted common code into ctx-core libraries (
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core/tree/master/packages/highlight.js">
		@ctx-core/highlight.js
	</a> &
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core/tree/master/packages/markdown">
		@ctx-core/markdown
	</a>).
I engaged in a process of concurrent development between the three repositories (2 apps & 2 libraries in ctx-core).
I also used
	<a target="_blank" href="https://lerna.js.org/">lerna.js</a> to manage the monorepo,
	<a target="_blank" href="https://direnv.net/">direnv</a>,
	& custom scripts.
This is a good case of developing multiple apps & libraries concurrently, which I'm happy to provide a
	free code review with anybody on your team who is interested.

If a global naming convention is adhered to,
	Natural Language Processing & code parse trees can also be utilized to
	analyze & link code in the Holochain Core, libraries, & application ecosystem
	with curated content (documentation, newsletters, blogs),
	creating a graph of related entities with a UI to navigate the graph.

Regardless of the outcome, I have created a systematic way of development
	where my practice is always moving forward in a cogent way.
A Meta-Philosophy-backed domain language methodology ensures framework development
	that scales with complexity across a multitude of
	organizations, applications, libraries, platforms, 3rd party apis
	while facilitating precise movement of abstraction to the appropriate library.

Sincerely, \
Brian
