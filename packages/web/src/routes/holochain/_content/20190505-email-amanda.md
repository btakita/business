Dear Amanda,

Thank you for your offer re: compensation for our work up to date.
We go the extra mile for any of our paying clients.
In this case, we are willing & able to consult without charge on any concepts
	that have been presented in the holochain-developer-prototype demo.
If there is a contract between Holochain & us, we are also willing to waive this charge.
Regardless of our future relationship, we are excited about the developments within the Holochain ecosystem
	and will continue to follow & participate.

The intention of our offering was as follows.
I (Brian) would be offering development & documentation services.
I was to be the subject of the position that we have been discussing.
For this project, Tracy was to assist me in client communication, attending meetings,
	design & systems ideas/feedback, writing, etc.
She has been immensely helpful for several projects & it's highly beneficial to continue investing in
	this collaboration.

A negotiation on rates took place, resulting in a price point well below industry average for a
	full stack developer who can create a scalable system of components, practices, documentation,
	cloud-based interactive development environment, & starter apps using the Holochain application stack.
Tracy is to be an addition to our offering, rather than the focus.

For my ecosystem of software, I face some similar challenges to Holochain, re: how to communicate a framework of tools,
	both of abstract forms & tangible software, to the public of various technical context & telos.
I have been developing software practices based on a
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy">Meta Philosophy</a> centered around:

* a scalable domain language
* patterns of definition
* globally unique names
* flat data structures
* reactive data flow

I have discovered that an enterprise-wide global domain language from business literature to code,
	results in a reduction of software & abstraction mapping needed to encapsulate ambiguous naming.
I have a couple of blog posts describing naming convention that adheres to the global domain language principle,
	that I have tested across a few organizations ranging in complexity.

* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.briantakita.com/posts/multi-underscore-tag-naming-convention-analysis/">
		Multi Underscore Tag Naming Convention Analysis
	</a>

I have created the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core">ctx-core</a> library,
	which is a composable monorepo used in several of my projects.
During this development, I have formed techniques to develop & reuse:

* application code
* library code
* web services
* web components
* project-specific development environments
* command line tools

My applicable experience lies crafting solutions that scale with complexity, interactivity, & reuse potential
	across the organization's domain.
While this practice is relatively young, I have obtained knowhow in creating a complex ecosystem of reuasable
	apps, components, & services which can be reused as a catalog of starter projects varying in domain specificity.

My core libraries serve as the best indicator of example of my ability to architect composable systems that are

* free of runtime framework dependencies
* small in payload
* low in memory usage
* fast in execution
* customizable for each development environment context

I'm happy to give a demo of the development environment as well.

As stated earlier, there has been confusion over our offerings, capabilities, & focus.

Sincerely, \
Brian
