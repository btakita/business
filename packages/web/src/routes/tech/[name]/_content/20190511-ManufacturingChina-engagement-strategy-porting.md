Thank you for the call.
As discussed...

I think it's best to start a new repo porting over the existing logic
	to utilize AWS Lambda, Svelte/Sapper, Auth0, & DynamoDB.

The dev repo will be built as monorepo, making the development
	& devops of a SOA simpler & similar to building a single app.

I will need a head start to establish the repo with patterns of development.

When the repo is ready, the team should have a meeting to figure out new roles. The following tracks will be needed:

* service development
* progressive web app & mobile web development
* mobile native app development
* devops

My next step can be to create a dev repository & begin porting the app.
We can get invoicing set up as well.
I'm using Wave & can accept ACH transfers.

Looking forward to our discussion tomorrow.

Brian
